# Re-scheduler Function

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that demonstrate how you can 
re-schedule a cloudwatch event. 

The lambda will be triggered on a Cloudwatch event. Normally, lambdas will be triggered on a fixed rate or schedule. 
Here, I will show you how you can re-schedule the lambda after processing of the current event.
